# AlphaEdge.ai Cross-Platform Synchronization Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for maintaining feature parity and data synchronization between the Streamlit web application and the Android mobile app for AlphaEdge.ai.

## Architecture Overview

AlphaEdge.ai implements a hybrid architecture to maximize code reuse while providing platform-specific optimizations:

1. **Shared Backend API**: A common backend API that serves both platforms
2. **Platform-specific Frontend**: Native implementations for each platform
3. **Hybrid Approach**: WebView integration for complex functionality when needed

## Data Synchronization Strategies

### 1. Centralized Database

- PostgreSQL database as the single source of truth
- RESTful API endpoints for both platforms to interact with the database
- Authentication tokens to ensure secure access across platforms

### 2. Offline Capability

- Android app includes local SQLite database for offline operation
- Synchronization occurs when connectivity is restored
- Conflict resolution prioritizes server-side data with timestamp-based versioning

### 3. Real-time Updates

- WebSocket connection for real-time market data and notifications
- Push notifications supported on both platforms
- Support for background syncing on Android

## Feature Parity Approach

### Core Features (Implemented on Both Platforms)

- User authentication and profile management
- Portfolio tracking and visualization
- Stock search and basic analysis
- Recommendations with time-based filters
- Settings and preferences

### Platform Optimizations

#### Web App Advantages
- Complex visualizations and interactive charts
- Detailed technical analysis tools
- Side-by-side comparisons

#### Android App Advantages
- Offline access to portfolio data
- Push notifications for price alerts
- Biometric authentication
- Home screen widgets for quick portfolio overview

### Hybrid Features via WebView

For complex features that would require significant duplicate development effort, the Android app uses a WebView bridge to the Streamlit app:

- Advanced technical analysis views
- Complex recommendation algorithms
- Help & Documentation sections

## Implementation Details

### API Structure

```
/api/v1/
  /auth     - Authentication endpoints
  /users    - User management
  /stocks   - Stock data and search
  /portfolio - Portfolio management
  /analysis - Stock analysis
  /recommendations - Recommendation engine
```

### Synchronization Process

1. User logs in (web or mobile)
2. App fetches initial data from API
3. Local storage caches relevant data
4. Real-time connection established for market updates
5. Changes on one platform sync to the server
6. Other platforms receive updates via polling or push

### Versioning Strategy

- API versioning to ensure backward compatibility
- Client-side version checking to prompt updates when needed
- Feature flags to enable/disable features based on client capabilities

## Testing Strategy

- Cross-platform testing suite to verify feature parity
- Automated synchronization tests
- Real-world network condition simulations
- Offline mode testing

## Future Enhancements

- Expand offline capabilities
- Add more platform-specific optimizations
- Introduce progressive web app (PWA) capabilities
- Implement cross-device notification synchronization
