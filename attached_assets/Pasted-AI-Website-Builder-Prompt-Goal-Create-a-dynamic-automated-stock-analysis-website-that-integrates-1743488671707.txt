AI Website Builder Prompt
Goal:
Create a dynamic, automated stock analysis website that integrates portfolio tracking, technical & fundamental analysis, and actionable recommendations.

Phase 1: Core Features
1. Portfolio Integration (Kite Profile)
User Authentication:
"Enable secure login via Kite API to fetch real-time portfolio data (holdings, trades, P&L). Display holdings in a dashboard with sorting by stock name, sector, or returns."

Portfolio Dashboard:
*"Design a dashboard with:

Current value, daily/weekly P&L.

Visual charts for portfolio allocation (pie/bar graphs).

Quick links to individual stock analysis pages."*

2. Weekly Stock Analysis
Automation:
"Schedule weekly analysis for all stocks in the portfolio. Trigger alerts via email/SMS when a stock meets predefined criteria (e.g., RSI >70, P/E ratio spikes)."

Analysis Criteria:

Technical Analysis:

Moving Averages:
"Plot 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Highlight crossovers (golden/death crosses) with buy/sell signals."

RSI:
"Display RSI trends over 14-day periods. Flag overbought (RSI >70) or oversold (RSI <30) stocks with color-coded alerts."

ADX:
*"Calculate ADX values and categorize trends:

Strong (ADX >25): Highlight in green.

Weak (ADX <20): Highlight in red."*

Fundamental Analysis:

P/E Ratio:
"Compare each stock’s P/E ratio to industry averages. Flag overvalued (P/E > industry) or undervalued (P/E < industry)."

ROE & Debt-to-Equity:
"Rank stocks by ROE (higher = better) and debt ratios (lower = safer). Add tooltips explaining metrics for novice users."

Volume/Price Changes:
"Track weekly volume spikes (>20% increase) and price swings (>5% change). Highlight anomalies in a ‘Volatility Watchlist’ section."

Promoters’ Shareholding:
"Scrape regulatory filings for promoter stake changes. Alert users if promoter holdings drop by >1% in a quarter."

3. Recommendation Engine
Action Logic:
*"Generate weekly recommendations using weighted scoring:

Buy: Strong fundamentals (ROE >15%, debt <0.5) + bullish technicals (rising ADX, RSI <60).

Sell: Overvalued (P/E > industry) + bearish technicals (death cross, RSI >70).

Hold: Neutral metrics or conflicting signals."*

Quantity Suggestions:
*"Calculate position size based on risk tolerance:

Aggressive: Allocate 5% of portfolio per ‘Buy’ signal.

Conservative: Allocate 2% per ‘Buy’ signal.
Display rationale for each recommendation (e.g., ‘INFY: Buy 10 shares due to rising ADX & undervalued P/E’)."*

Phase 2: Advanced Features (Optional)
Backtesting Module:
"Allow users to test strategies against historical data. Example: ‘How would a 50-day MA strategy perform on Reliance since 2020?’"

Social Sentiment Integration:
"Incorporate AI-driven sentiment analysis from news and Twitter to supplement technical/fundamental signals."

Design & Tech Stack Suggestions
Frontend:
"Use React.js for interactive charts (via ApexCharts) and a clean, minimalist UI. Prioritize mobile responsiveness."

Backend:
"Python (Django/Flask) for analysis logic. Integrate Zerodha Kite API for live data and AWS Lambda for weekly cron jobs."

Database:
"PostgreSQL to store historical data and user portfolios."

Example Output
Stock: TCS

Technical:

MA Crossover: Golden cross detected (50-day > 200-day).

RSI: 65 (neutral).

Fundamental:

P/E: 33 (industry avg: 28) → Overvalued.

ROE: 18% (strong).

Recommendation:
“Hold: Conflicting signals (bullish MA crossover vs overvalued P/E). Monitor for RSI >70.”
